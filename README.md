# Competitive-Analysis-for-a-Local-Hospitality-Business

Description: In this project, we delve into revenue analysis of a local hospitality business particularly a hotel, with a primary objective of uncovering insights that can drive better business decisions and enhance growth. We decided to conduct the revenue analysis by analysing 3 key metrics: Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), and Occupancy Rate, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of the business's performance relative to its competitors by calculating the competitor's index using the specified 3 metrics. 

We have analysed 2 datasets catering to different purposes for a better assessment 

## Dataset 1: Performance Analysis (2013-2016)
Structure: Includes columns for Date, Revenue, Month, Year, and RevPAR.

1.Historical Performance Analysis: Analyse the hotelâ€™s business performance in terms of revenue over the years from 2013 to 2016.

2.Competitor Comparison: Measure the business's monthly performance against competitors for the year 2016 using RevPAR and growth rates to compare the business's metrics with competitors to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.

## Dataset 2: Detailed monthly analysis 
Structure: Comprehensive dataset with guest-specific details, booking sources, room types, rates, and occupancy details.

1.Competitor Index for RevPAR: Benchmark the hotel's RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) against its competitors on a monthly basis to evaluate how well the hotel is utilizing its room inventory to generate revenue compared to competitors, identifying areas where the hotel may be underperforming or excelling.

2.Competitor Index for Occupancy: Compare the hotel's occupancy rate against competitors' rates in each month to assess the hotel's ability to attract guests compared to competitors during a specific period, highlighting strengths or weaknesses in marketing or operational efficiency.

3.Competitor Index for ADR: Evaluate the hotel's ADR (Average Daily Rate) and its competitiveness in pricing relative to competitors to identify if the hotel is pricing competitively in the market.

## Tools/Techniques Used:
Excel: Utilized Excel functions (e.g., SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS) for data aggregation, calculation of metrics, and competitor indices.

## Outcome: Empowered the business to make informed decisions aimed at optimizing revenue, improving occupancy rates, and strategically setting ADR to outperform competitors.
